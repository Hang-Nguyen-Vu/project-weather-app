# Weather App

A pair project in which we build a simple weather dashboard that tells today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forecast using Open Weather Map API.

## The problem

We fetch data from the API using fetch() in JavaScript and present the data on the city, its weather description, temperature, sunrise and sunset time for today as well as the forecast for the next five days including weather description with icons, temperature, wind speed. The Date object is used to convert the data in the JSON response to human readable data on weekday and time in the 24-hour format. The project was done first in master branch on Github, then in separate branches, and then in master branch again. 

Possible improvements include:
- Styling: making a background gradient; including visual indicators (e.g. photos) for the type of weather, cloudy/sunny/rainy/etc.; changing the colours of the page based on the weather
- Javascript: using another endpoint of the Weather API to include supplementary information, e.g. "feels like" temperature etc.
